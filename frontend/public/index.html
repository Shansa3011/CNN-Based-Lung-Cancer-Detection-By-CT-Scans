      <h1>Types of Lung Cancer</h1>

      <div id="adenocarcinoma">
        <h2>Adenocarcinoma</h2>
        <p>Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that forms in the glandular tissues of the body. These tissues are found in various organs and are responsible for producing and releasing substances like mucus, digestive juices, or other fluids. Adenocarcinomas can develop in many parts of the body, including the lungs, colon, breasts, pancreas, prostate, and stomach.</p>
        <p>The name "adenocarcinoma" comes from "adeno-" meaning gland, and "carcinoma," which is a type of cancer that starts in the skin or the tissues that line internal organs. This cancer is characterized by the abnormal growth of glandular cells, which can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).</p>
        <p>Adenocarcinomas can vary in terms of aggressiveness and treatment options, depending on the location and stage of the cancer. Treatment often involves surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these approaches. Early detection and treatment are crucial for better outcomes.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="large-cell-carcinoma">
        <h2>Large Cell Carcinoma</h2>
        <p>Large cell carcinoma is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is one of the main categories of lung cancer. It is characterized by large, abnormal-looking cells that can be seen under a microscope. These cells do not have the specific features that classify them into other types of lung cancer, such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
        <p>Large cell carcinoma can occur in any part of the lung and may sometimes appear in multiple locations within the lung. It tends to grow and spread more quickly than some other types of non-small cell lung cancers, making early detection and treatment important. Symptoms can include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and unexplained weight loss, though these symptoms are not specific to large cell carcinoma.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis typically involves imaging studies such as chest X-rays and CT scans, as well as a biopsy to examine the cancer cells under a microscope. Treatment options for large cell carcinoma may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, depending on the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="squamous-cell-carcinoma">
        <h2>Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2>
        <p>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that originates in squamous cells, which are flat, thin cells that make up the outer layer of the skin and line various organs and structures within the body. This type of carcinoma can occur in several areas, including the skin, lungs, mouth, throat, esophagus, and cervix.</p>
        <p>In the lungs, SCC is a type of non-small cell lung cancer. It often starts in the central part of the lungs or in one of the main airways (bronchi). SCC can also develop in the mouth, throat, and esophagus, often associated with tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Cervical SCC is linked to HPV infection and is one of the most common types of cervical cancer.</p>
        <p>Risk factors for developing SCC include prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds, exposure to certain chemicals, smoking, HPV infection, and a history of precancerous conditions like actinic keratosis. Symptoms vary depending on the location but may include persistent sores or lumps, changes in existing skin lesions, difficulty swallowing, persistent cough or hoarseness, and unusual bleeding or discharge.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis typically involves a biopsy to examine the cells under a microscope. Treatment options depend on the location and stage of the cancer and may include surgical removal, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Early detection and treatment are important, especially for skin SCC, as it can sometimes metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) if not treated promptly.</p>
